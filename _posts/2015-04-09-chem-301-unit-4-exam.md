Given that ∆fH◦Fe2O3(s) = −826 kJ mol−1 what would you predict for the spontaneity of the following reaction

2Fe2O3(s) → 4Fe(s) + 3O2(g)

1. there is no way to predict the spontaneity of this reaction
2. it would be spontaneous only at high temperatures **correct**
3. it would never be spontaneous
4. it would be spontaneous at all temperatures
5. it would be spontaneous only at low temperatures

**Explanation:**  
The reaction as written is the reverse of twice the formation of Fe2O3. As such this reaction is extremely endothermic (∆H >> 0). However, the entropy change for this reaction should be positive as it generates three moles of gas. The enthalpy changes cause an increase in the free energy, but the entropy change will cause the free energy to decrease. At high temperatures the entropy will dominate and the free energy change will be negative.

Which of the following is always true for a spontaneous process at constant temperature?

1. ∆S = q / T
2. ∆S > 0
3. ∆Ssystem + ∆Ssurroundings > 0 **correct**
4. ∆S < q / T
5. ∆Ssystem + ∆Ssurroundings = q / T

**Explanation:**  
The entropy of a system or its surroundings may increase or decrease. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that in spontaneous changes, the universe tends toward a state of greater disorder; that is, entropy increases (∆S > 0).

Rank the following systems by entropy, from least to greatest:
a) 1 mol of pure ice
b) 1 mol of water with 1 mol of salt dissolved in it.
c) 1 mol of pure water

1. c < b < a
2. a < b < c
3. c < a < b
4. b < c < a
5. b < a < c
6. a < c < b **correct**

**Explanation:**  
Entropy increases as systems go through endothermic phase transitions and when there is more matter or more dispersed matter present.

Calculate the standard enthalpy of combustion (∆cH) of t-butyl acetate, C6H12O2(l).

1. -125 kJ/mol
2. -4080 kJ/mol
3. -4635 kJ/mol
4. -3525 kJ/mol **correct**
5. -2970 kJ/mol
6. -4371 kJ/mol
7. -3261 kJ/mol

**Explanation:**  
The balanced equation is:  
C6H12O2(l) + 8O2(g) → 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(l)  
∆cH = 6(−394) + 6(−286) − (−555)  
∆cH = −2364 + −1716 + 555  
∆cH = −3525

Consider the reaction

2 SO2(g) + O2(g) → 2 SO3(g)

Which statement is true for this reaction?

1. ∆S < 0 **correct**
2. Sm◦ = 0 for O2(g)
3. ∆S > 0
4. ∆S = 0

**Explanation:**  
For the reaction 3 mol gas → 2 mol gas. The fewer the moles of gas, the lower the disorder, so ∆S is negative.

Calculate the standard reaction enthalpy for the reaction

NO2(g) → NO(g) + O(g)

Given:  
O2(g) → 2 O(g)  
∆H◦ = +498.4 kJ/mol  
NO(g) + O3(g) → NO2(g) + O2(g)

3O2(g) → 2 O3(g) .  
∆H◦ = +285.4 kJ/mol  

1. +306 kJ/mol **correct**
2. +555 kJ/mol
3. +192 kJ/mol

What is ∆Suniv for a reaction conducted at 100◦C and for which ∆S is 170 J · mol−1 · K−1 and ∆H is 43.2 kJ · mol−1.

1. −262 J · mol−1 · K−1
2. 285.8 J · mol−1 · K−1
3. 602 J · mol−1 ·K−1
4. 54.2 J · mol−1 · K−1 **correct**

**Explanation:**  
∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr  
= 170 J · mol−1 · K−1  
− 43200 J · mol−1 373 K  
= 54.2 J · mol−1 · K−1

Which of the following reactions as written corresponds to a standard formation reaction?

1. SO2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → SO3(g)
2. 2H (g) + O2(g) → H2O2 (l)
3. Na(s) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → NaCl(s) **correct**
4. 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l)
5. CO2(s) → CO2(g)

**Explanation:**  
All of the reactants in a formation reaction must be ELEMENTS in their thermochemical standard state. AND, to match table values, only 1 MOLE of product can be formed because standard table values are in kJ/mol. Only the NaCl fits this definition. The H2O reaction unfortunately is forming 2 moles of water instead of one.

The enthalpy of fusion of methanol (CH3OH) is 3.16 kJ/mol. How much heat would be absorbed or released upon freezing 25.6 grams of methanol?

1. 0.253 kJ absorbed
2. 3.95 kJ absorbed
3. 2.52 kJ absorbed
4. 0.253 kJ released
5. 3.95 kJ released
6. 2.52 kJ released **correct**

**Explanation:**  
MW CH3OH = 32.042g  
∆H(fusion) = −∆H(freezing)  
q = 25.6 g × (1 mol / 32.042 g mol) × (−3.16 kJ / mol)  
= −2.525 kJ

4. -235.9
5. -424.3
6. -213.5
7. -165.2
8. -552.3
9. -269.5
10. -335.2

Correct answer: −424.3 kJ/mol of Y.

Sodium is a metal that reacts violently with water. Chlorine is a toxic, choking gas. So it’s a really good thing that when you put salt on your fries (chips) that it doesnt suddenly turn into sodium metal and chlorine gas. Why is this the case?

1. The standard enthalpy of formation of sodium chloride is negative.
2. The standard Gibbs free energy of formation of sodium chloride is negative. **correct**
3. The standard entropy change for the formation of sodium chloride is negative.
4. Salt dissolves in the water in your food. 5. Salt has a really high melting point.

**Explanation:**  
The standard Gibbs free energy of formation of sodium chloride is negative so the process is spontaneous. Thus ’unforming’ sodium chloride is nonspontaneous, so sodium chloride is stable.
