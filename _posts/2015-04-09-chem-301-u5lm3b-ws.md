##U5LM3B-WS Limiting Reagent & Percent Yield

---

I. Methanol, CH3OH, is used as a fuel. Recall that combustion reactions produce carbon dioxide and water.

1) Write a balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction.  
**2CH3OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 4H2O**

---

2) How many moles of carbon dioxide are produced in each of the following cases?  
Include calculations quantifying the number of moles left over for any excess reactants.

a) 2 mols of CH3OH react with 3 mols of O2.  
*2 mol CH3OH x 2 mol CO2 / 2 mol CH3OH =* **2 mol CO2 max**  
*3molO2 x 2molCO2 / 3 mol O2 = 2 mol CO2 max*  
*These reagents are in stoichiometric equivalence, so both reagents react completely.*  
**0 moles of excess reagent**  

b) 2 mols of CH3OH react with 2 mols of O2  
*2 mol CH3OH x 2 mol CO2 / 2 mol CH3OH = 2 mol CO2 max*  
*2 mol O2 x 2 mol CO2 / 3 mol O2 =* **1.33 mol CO2 max**  
*2 mol O2 x 2 mol CH3OH / 3 mol O2 = 1.33 mol CH3OH used*  
CH3OH excess reagent  
O2 limiting reagent  
2-1.33 = **0.67 moles excess methanol**  

c) 3 mols of CH3OH react with 3 mols of O2  
*Perform hypothetical maximum calculations as above. Another way of determining the limiting reagent is to say...” 3 moles of methanol would require 4.5 moles of oxygen. We only have 3 moles of O2, so oxygen must be limiting.”*  
*3 mol CH3OH x 3 mol O2 / 2 mol CH3OH = 4.5 mol O2 required* ... O2 is limiting  
All of the oxygen will react...  
*3molO2 x 2molCO2 / 3 mol O2 =* **2 mol CO2 produced**  
*3 mol O2 x 2 mol CH3OH / 3 mol O2 = 2 mol CH3OH used;* **1 mole of excess methanol**  

d) 88 g of CH3OH react with 88 g of O2  
*These problems require you to convert grams using the molar mass before performing steps above. Note: methanol and oxygen have different molecular formulas but happen to have similar molar masses.*  
*88 g CH3OH x 1 mol CH3OH / 32 g CH3OH x 2 mol CO2 / 2 mol CH3OH = 2.75 mol CO2 max*  
*CH3OH excess reagent*  
*88 g O2 x 1 mol O2 / 32 g O2 x 2molCO2 / 3 mol O2 =* **1.83 mol CO2 max**  
*O2 limiting reagent*  
*1.83 mol CO2 x 2 mol CH3OH / 2 mol CO2 = 1.83 mol CH3OH used*  
*88 g CH3OH x 1 mol CH3OH / 32 g CH3OH = 2.75 mol CH3OH available – 1.83 mol used =* **0.92 mol excess CH3OH**  

e) 15 g of CH3OH react with 12 g of O2  
*15g CH3OH x 1 mol / 32 g = 0.47 mol CH3OH available ... x(3mol O2 / 2mol CH3OH) = 0.71 mol O2 required*  
*12g O2 x 1 mol / 32 g = only 0.375 mol O2 available.... So O2 is limiting.*  
*All of the oxygen will react... 0.375 mol O2 x 2 mol CO2*  
*0.375 mol O2 x 2 mol CH3OH / 3 mol O2 =* **0.25 mol CO2 produced**  
*= 0.25 mol CH3OH used; (0.47–0.25) =* **0.22 mole excess methanol**  

f) 25 g of CH3OH react with 35 g of O2  
*0.78 mol CH3OH available*  
*1.17 mol O2 required*  
*1.09 mol O2 available*  
**0.73 mol CO2 produced**  
**0.05 mole excess methanol**

II. Propane is by-product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining. It is commonly used as a fuel for engines, oxy-gas torches, barbecues, portable stoves, and residential central heating.  
**C3H8 +5O2 → 3CO2 +4H2O**  
Note: C3H8 and CO2 have different molecular formulas but happen to have similar molar masses.  

a) What mass of CO2 is produced when 6.5 g of propane is reacted with 14.2 g of O2?  
**11.7 g CO2 produced (theoretical yield)**  

b) The actual yield of the reaction described above is 8.0 g of carbon dioxide. What is the percent yield?  
Percent yield is how much you got out of how much you could theoretically get... 8.0 g CO2 / 11.7 g CO2 x 100% = **68 % yield**

---

III. Nitrogen dioxide reacts with hydrogen to produce nitrogen and water. When 125g of nitrogen dioxide are allowed to react with excess hydrogen, the percent yield is 35%. How many grams of each product are actually formed during this process?  
**2 NO2 + 4 H2 → N2 + 4 H2O**  
**13.3 g N2 produced**  
**34.3 g H2O produced**
